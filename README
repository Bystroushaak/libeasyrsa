easyrsa is just C/D wrapper over polarssl which allows manipulation with keys 
and signing/verifing messages.

First of all, rename Makefile.xxx (depends on your platform) to just "Makefile".

Then run:
	make download # downloads polarssl from svn (you have to have svn installed in PATH)
	make          # create out/libeasyrsa.a (or out/libeasyrsa.lib)


	
- Windows note: ----------------------------------------------------------------

Makefile expects installed msys (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS), mingw-gcc and
latest dmd (2.054).

On windows, both libraries (polarssl & easyrsa) are converted into OMF object 
format. That is because DMD can't handle COFF, so you can't use GCC (which can't 
handle OMF :S) for linking into C program.

If you want to use easyrsa with gcc on windows (COFF), run these commands:

	gcc easyrsa.c -c
	ar -rcs libeasyrsa.a *.o
	cp polarssl/library/*.a .
