easyrsa is just C/D wrapper over polarssl which allows manipulation with keys 
and signing/verifing messages.

First of all, rename Makefile.xxx (depends on your platform) to just "Makefile".

Then run:
	make download # downloads polarssl from svn (you have to have svn installed in PATH)
	make          # create out/libeasyrsa.a (or out/libeasyrsa.lib)

On windows, both libraries (polarssl & easyrsa) are converted into OMF object 
format. That is because DMD can't handle COFF, so you can't use GCC (which can't 
handle OMF :S) for linking into C program.
